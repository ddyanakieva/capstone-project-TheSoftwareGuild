It is a personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>\r\n<p>This content is part of my Dev Concepts series.</p>\r\n<p>So what is it about?</p>\r\n<p>Many people may tell you that both terms refer to the same concept. Personally, I don\'t agree. The way I see things, software development is the \"what\" (i.e., the activity) and software engineering is broader; it corresponds to the \"what\" and the \"how\" (i.e., the process, the approaches, the methodologies, etc).</p>\r\n<p>NOTE: Before going any further, I want to clearly state that the term \"engineering\" might be wrongly interpreted. Software engineering takes inspiration from engineering and tries to apply similar structured approaches to software development, but fundamentally, Software development/engineering is and will remain a creative endeavor. The software world is complex. Even if we try to apply engineering techniques to professionalize the way we work, it is hard to predict software development time, to provide verifiable proof that a piece of software does what it should be doing, etc.</p>\r\n<p>I like the definition of the IEEE standards body:</p>\r\n<p>Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software (IEEE 610.12-1990)</p>\r\n<p>To create software, we perform various activities, and how we approach those activities has a huge impact on the results and on the overall quality. Writing code is only a part of the story. There are many more activities around coding. For instance, before coding, we need to understand user needs (i.e., their requirements). Then, we need to clarify the business rules (e.g., is X accepted or not, when, how, why), the workflows (e.g., what happens before/after X), the data models (i.e., what concepts/data will the application manipulate), the data flows, etc. Still before coding, we also need to architect and design the solution so that it is built on solid grounds.</p>\r\n<p>The coding part itself is also critical of course, and there are many dimensions/things to take care of. Security is also something of the utmost importance. Finally, once code has been written for an application, it needs to be built, tested/validated, released, deployed, monitored, maintained, etc. My Dev Concepts series as a whole discusses those topics.</p>\r\n<p>Luckily, there\'s actually a generally accepted standard defining a set of phases for software development projects. It is called the Software/System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Personally, I think that all software developers should clearly understand the SDLC and apply it in their projects, whether big or small.</p>\r\n<p>Next to the software development phases, there are other things to consider like the software development approaches/methodologies (e.g., Agile, XP, etc) and project management techniques (e.g., PMBOK), which greatly impact the way we work, and collaborate with each other.</p>\r\n<p>To finish this short post, I\'ll leave you with a wonderful quote from Margaret Hamilton, one of the pioneers of software engineering:</p>\r\n<p>Software during the early days of this project was treated like a stepchild and not taken as seriously as other engineering disciplines, such as hardware engineering; and it was regarded as an art and as magic, not a science. I had always believed that both art and science were involved in its creation, but at that time most thought otherwise. Knowing this, I fought to bring the software legitimacy so that it (and those building it) would be given its due respect and thus I began to use the term “software engineering” to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering; yet, treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process. When I first started using this phrase, it was considered to be quite amusing. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. Software eventually and necessarily gained the same respect as any other discipline. (Margaret Hamilton, Lead software engineer of the Apollo Project)</p>\r\n<p>References Conclusion</p>\r\n<p>In this short article, I\'ve introduced the notion of software engineering. It\'s just an idea, a simple concept. And that\'s the magic; if you learn the concepts one by one, then you\'ll quickly become one of us, a software crafter. It\'s not that hard; it\'s like everything, it just takes time.</p>\r\n<p>That’s it for today!</p>\r\n<p>PS: If you want to learn tons of other cool things about product/software/Web development, then check out the Dev Concepts series, subscribe to my newsletter, and come say hi on Twitter!</p>','2021-08-29','2021-10-31',1),(10,'SpaceX launches Dragon cargo ship to space station with fresh food, science gear and Girl Scout experiments','<p>Ending a two-month launch drought, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket boosted a Dragon cargo ship into orbit early Sunday for the company\'s 23rd supply run to the International Space Station, this one carrying 4,300 pounds of equipment, science gear, food and other supplies.</p>\r\n<p>Running 24 hours late because of stormy weather, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and the nine Merlin engines in the Falcon\'s first stage ignited on schedule at 3:14 a.m. EDT, pushing the rocket away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.</p>\r\n<p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lights up the pre-dawn sky as it climbs away from the Kennedy Space Center early Sunday, boosting a Dragon cargo ship into orbit for a supply run to the International Space Station. William Harwood/CBS News</p>\r\n<p>The first stage, making its fourth flight, powered the vehicle out of the thick lower atmosphere and then fell away, handing off to the rocket\'s second stage to continue the climb to space.</p>\r\n<p>A few seconds after separation, the first stage flipped around, restarted three engines to reverse course, plunged back into the lower atmosphere and landed on SpaceX\'s new droneship, \"A Shortfall of Gravitas,\" the company\'s third sea-going landing pad. Touchdown marked the 90th booster recovery for SpaceX, its 67th at sea.</p>\r\n<p>For its first booster recovery, the new barge was towed to the touchdown point. But the ship is designed to carry out future recoveries on its own.</p>\r\n<p>\"It was designed and built to travel out to sea, find its position, receive the rocket and then actually secure the rocket to the ship, all robotically ... and then travel back to port for it to be offloaded completely autonomously,\" said Sarah Walker, SpaceX director of Dragon mission management.</p>\r\n<p>\"We\'re in the final phases of testing out all of that capability,\" she said. \"I\'m really excited to see this vehicle come online. We really need it.\"</p>\r\n<p>About one minute after the first stage landed, the Falcon 9\'s second stage completed the climb to a preliminary orbit and released the Dragon cargo ship to fly on its own 11 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff.</p>\r\n<p>The capsule was launched directly into the plane of the space station\'s orbit and if all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with its quarry around 11 a.m. Sunday, gliding in for an automated docking at the lab\'s forward port.</p>\r\n<p>The Dragon is packed with 2,305 pounds of science gear, nearly 1,000 pounds of needed equipment and spare parts and 1,058 pounds of crew supplies, including \"a pretty good amount of fresh fruit,\" said Joel Montalbano, space station program manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>','2021-08-29','2021-08-29',1),(11,'I Start Each Day With Coffee, but This Concentrate Broke My Usual Routine - For Good','<p>There are few things about my routine I take more seriously than my morning cup of coffee. I start each day with fresh coffee from my french press - all the way from grinding the coffee beans, to boiling water in a kettle, and perfecting the amount of time before pouring it into my favorite mug. Especially during the pandemic, it has become a ritual that fuels me both mentally and physically.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from the time it takes from start to finish, the only flaw is that I also love iced coffee. My process remains the same, but iced coffee requires hours of advanced planning to allow time for the coffee to cool to room temperature before chilling in the refrigerator for a few more hours. I often prefer iced coffee, but it\'s something I rarely think to prepare the night before.</p>\r\n<p>When I got the opportunity to test Jot\'s Ultra Coffee ($24), a liquid concentrate that is 20 times more concentrated than regular coffee, I jumped at the opportunity. I hoped this would be my entry into quick and easy iced coffee without compromising taste or cost. It did not disappoint.</p>\r\n<p>I followed Jot\'s iced coffee recipe by combining 1 tablespoon of Ultra Coffee, 6-8 ounces of water, and ice. Without any milk, I really enjoyed sticking to the 8-ounce recommendation. It was strong without being overpowering. With milk, the 6-ounce recommendation worked perfectly. It was still rich and creamy without being watered down. Either way, my morning coffee tasted like I got it from a high-end local coffee shop, but saved me the time it took to get there and back. From start to finish, the iced coffee only took about a minute to make, rather than the usual 10 from my routine.</p>\r\n<p>Each bottle of Jot Ultra Coffee costs $24 and is supposed to make 14 cups of coffee, which totals to less than $2 a cup. After taking my kettle, coffee grinder, french press, and coffee beans (anywhere from $5-$15 a bag) into account, this definitely reduces the price of each cup without losing the taste. Jot\'s website offers free shipping if you purchase more than one bottle, allowing your end-of-day cost to truly remain lower than those of high-end local coffee shops.</p>\r\n<p>I was also impressed by the waste (or lack thereof!) of Jot\'s process - from bean to your mug. The glass bottles can be recycled (though the company recommends removing the cork for easier processing) or upcycled, the coffee is ethically sourced, and the beans are composted. Adding that to water, ice, and possibly plant-based milk, a morning cup leaves little trace other than that associated with shipping.</p>\r\n<p>For mornings I\'m craving iced coffee (or simply don\'t have the time for my usual routine!), I will definitely be switching to Jot\'s Ultra Coffee. It is too good and efficient not to. While Jot offers the same hot water or hot milk amount recommendations to make a black coffee or hot latte, I love my slow french press coffee routine too much to give it away fully, especially as fall and winter roll around. That said, Jot\'s Ultra Coffee has certainly also won its rightful place in my routine.</p>','2021-08-29','2021-08-29',1),(12,'Want More Women in Science? Start Early And Listen To Girls','<p>Girls participating in a GirlsWhoSTEAM slime workshop.</p>\r\n<p>Sriya Tallapragada</p>\r\n<p>Women account for only 29% of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) labor force and 34.5% of STEM faculty at the nation’s colleges and universities. Women of color are even more underrepresented — making up 4.8% of the STEM workforce and 3.8% of STEM faculty. For decades, researchers have told us that “Girls and women are systematically tracked away from science and math throughout their educations, limiting their training and options to go into these fields as adults.” The challenge is how early do educators and parents need to start with girls in order to eliminate this gender gap.</p>\r\n<p>Middle school student Sriya Tallapragada decided to take on this challenge. According to Sriya, “When the coronavirus pandemic shut down my school, I found myself stuck at home with nothing but my computer as company. Luckily, as a 14-year old STEM aficionado and introvert, this was all I needed. I found the large amounts of time on my hands to be the perfect opportunity to meet my goal of working to close the gender gap in STEM.”</p>\r\n<p>Sriya Tallapragada and her computer through which she leads GirlsWhoSTEAM</p>\r\n<p>Sriya Tallapragada</p>\r\n<p>Sriya is the founder and executive director of GirlsWhoSTEAM, an online global community for girls in STEM. Over the past year, her organization has had more than 2,000 participants in its online workshops. This past May, GirlsWhoSTEAM held a virtual conference focused on introducing high school girls to STEM professionals — 1000 girls participated. GirlsWhoSTEAM also sponsors programs for elementary and middle school girls. Sriya and her organization host workshops such as “The Science Behind Slime” and “DIY Lava Lamps.” She shared, “This is a fun way for girls to learn science concepts through the inclusion of the arts (i.e., the ‘A’ in STEAM), which sparks their interest for STEM in a way that most standardized curricula simply cannot.”</p>\r\n<p>Sriya was introduced to the world of math and science competition by her teacher in third grade and was immediately hooked. In her words, “It was a world where I was no longer bound by the syllabus my school followed. While some of these competitions were very demanding and time-consuming, they allowed me to be exposed to a community where I was no longer just a number-obsessed teenager, but instead a leader, a teammate, and a scholar.”</p>\r\n<p>However, Sriya’s experience in STEM was not a perfect one. From TV shows to Halloween costumes, she couldn’t understand why there were no women represented in STEM. As Sriya explains, “I was equally as confused when boys laughed at me after sharing that I wanted to be an astronaut, or when one of my childhood best friends told me that as a girl, I could only be a nurse.” Unfortunately, these negative stereotypes are foisted on young people from a very early age. They create the illusion that women are somehow less competent in these science than men are.</p>\r\n<p>As Sriya grew older and began taking more advanced science courses, she started to notice the impact of these stereotypes on girls and how they lead to the gender gap in STEM. Sriya shared, “A lot of my female peers began losing interest in STEM courses, causing these classes to become increasingly male-dominated. As a girl looking to break into this field, there have been several moments where I have felt as though I didn’t belong. My breaking point was entering a math competition, only to find that in a room with more than 20 students, I was the only girl.” Based on her own experiences and those of her peers, Sriya knew she wanted to do her part to change the gender gap.</p>\r\n<p>Girls eager to participate in a GirlsWhoSTEAM event.</p>\r\n<p>Sriya Tallapragada</p>\r\n<p>Given her work in STEM, Sriya is eager to share recommendations for schools and colleges that want to change the gender gap and provide opportunities for girls and women in STEM. She suggests that websites and marketing materials show representation of women in STEM. She also notes that classes should include exposure to women mentors and STEM role models because girls need to be able to visualize themselves in STEM careers and seeing women helps them to do this. Sriya urges teachers and professors to make STEM curricula more accessible to students from a variety of perspectives. Examples should be representative of various ways of thinking, cultures, and perspectives.</p>\r\n<p>From Sriya’s vantage point, “It is our responsibility as a society to cultivate a future where girls are encouraged to pursue these subjects by friends, family, and teachers. Women should never have to worry about following their passion, and should be welcomed into the STEM community, respected, and valued.”</p>','2021-08-29','2021-08-29',1);
